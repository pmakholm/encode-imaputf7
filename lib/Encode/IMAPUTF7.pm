=head1 NAME

Encode::IMAPUTF7 - modification of UTF-7 encoding for IMAP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Encode qw/encode decode/;

  print encode('IMAP-UTF-7', 'RÃ©pertoire');
  print decode('IMAP-UTF-7', R&AOk-pertoire');

=head1 ABSTRACT

IMAP mailbox names are encoded in a modified UTF7 when names contains 
international characters outside of the printable ASCII range. The
modified UTF-7 encoding is defined in RFC2060 (section 5.1.3).

There is another CPAN module with same purpose, Unicode::IMAPUtf7. However, it
works correctly only with strings, which encoded form does not
contain plus sign. For example, the Cyrillic string
\x{043f}\x{0440}\x{0435}\x{0434}\x{043b}\x{043e}\x{0433} is represented in UTF-7 as
+BD8EQAQ1BDQEOwQ+BDM- Note the second plus sign 4 characters before the end. 
Unicode::IMAPUtf7 encodes the above string as +BD8EQAQ1BDQEOwQ&BDM- 
which is not valid modified UTF-7 (the ampersand and
the plus are swapped). The problem is solved by the current module,
which is slightly modified Encode::Unicode::UTF7 and has nothing common with
Unicode::IMAPUtf7.

=head1 RFC2060 - section 5.1.3 - Mailbox International Naming Convention

By convention, international mailbox names are specified using a
modified version of the UTF-7 encoding described in [UTF-7].  The
purpose of these modifications is to correct the following problems
with UTF-7:

1) UTF-7 uses the "+" character for shifting; this conflicts with
   the common use of "+" in mailbox names, in particular USENET
   newsgroup names.

2) UTF-7's encoding is BASE64 which uses the "/" character; this
   conflicts with the use of "/" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

3) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "\"; this conflicts with
   the use of "\" as a popular hierarchy delimiter.

4) UTF-7 prohibits the unencoded usage of "~"; this conflicts with
   the use of "~" in some servers as a home directory indicator.

5) UTF-7 permits multiple alternate forms to represent the same
   string; in particular, printable US-ASCII chararacters can be
   represented in encoded form.

In modified UTF-7, printable US-ASCII characters except for "&"
represent themselves; that is, characters with octet values 0x20-0x25
and 0x27-0x7e.  The character "&" (0x26) is represented by the two-
octet sequence "&-".

All other characters (octet values 0x00-0x1f, 0x7f-0xff, and all
Unicode 16-bit octets) are represented in modified BASE64, with a
further modification from [UTF-7] that "," is used instead of "/".
Modified BASE64 MUST NOT be used to represent any printing US-ASCII
character which can represent itself.

"&" is used to shift to modified BASE64 and "-" to shift back to US-
ASCII.  All names start in US-ASCII, and MUST end in US-ASCII (that
is, a name that ends with a Unicode 16-bit octet MUST end with a "-
").

For example, here is a mailbox name which mixes English, Japanese,
and Chinese text: ~peter/mail/&ZeVnLIqe-/&U,BTFw-
